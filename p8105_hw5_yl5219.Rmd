### Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_data = read.csv("./homicide-data.csv")
```

The dataset has `r ncol(homicide_data)` variables and `r nrow(homicide_data)` observations. It contains variables including `uid`, `reported_date`, `victim_last`, `victim_first`, `victim_race`, `victim_age`, `victim_sex`, `city`, `state`, `lat`, `lon`, `disposition`.


```{r message=FALSE}
homicide_data = read.csv("./homicide-data.csv")|>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ","),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    ))|>
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") |>
  group_by(city_state, resolution)|>
  summarise(n_obs = n())

knitr::kable(homicide_data)
```


```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa, AL") 
```

The resulting dataframe has `r nrow(homicide_df)` entries, on variables that include the victim name, race, age, and sex; the date the homicide was reported; and the location of the homicide. In cleaning, I created a `city_state` variable that includes both city and state, and a `resolution` variable to indicate whether the case was closed by arrest. I also excluded one entry in Tulsa, AL, which is not a major US city and is most likely a data entry error. 

In the next code chunk, I group within cities and summarize to produce the total number of homicides and the number that are solved. 

```{r}
city_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  select(city_state, disposition, resolution) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved"))
```

Focusing only on Baltimore, MD, I can use the `prop.test` and `broom::tidy` functions to obtain an estimate and CI of the proportion of unsolved homicides in that city. The table below shows those values.

```{r}
bmore_test = 
  prop.test(
    x = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
    n = filter(city_homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) 

broom::tidy(bmore_test) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Building on this code, I can use functions in the `purrr` package to obtain estimates and CIs for the proportion of unsolved homicides in each city in my dataset. The code below implements this analysis. 

```{r}
test_results = 
  city_homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(hom_unsolved, hom_total, \(x, y) prop.test(x = x, n = y)),
    tidy_tests = map(prop_tests, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate))
```

Finally, I make a plot showing the estimate (and CI) of the proportion of unsolved homicides in each city.

```{r}
test_results %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

This figure suggests a very wide range in the rate at which homicides are solved -- Chicago is noticeably high and, given the narrowness of the CI, likely is the location of many homicides.
